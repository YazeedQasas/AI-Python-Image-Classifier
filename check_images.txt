1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.  
Answer: Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet and VGG) have classified the breed of the dog "Dog_01.jpg" as
"German Shepherd, German Shepherd Dog, German Police Dog, Alsatian". There were no differences in the classifications among the models for this image despite it being inverted.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.  
Answer: Yes, all three modelarchitectures classify correctly.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Frog_01.jpg and Bucket_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications. 
Answer: Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) correctly classified Frog_01.jpg and Bucket_01.jpg as not being dogs. There were no misclassifications for these images, with
both labeled as "not a dog"â€‹

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification
Answer: All three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) performed equally well in classifying the four uploaded images, thus you may conclude any of these architectures could be considered 
the best for this specific task, but it is worth keeping in mind that on a larger dataset, the models might not perform as well. 

Based on our final results from the set of 40 images, VGG would be the best model to use for larger datasets as it performed the best.
VGG: 95.2%
ResNet: 90.6%
AlexNet: 88.7%
